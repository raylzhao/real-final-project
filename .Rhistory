development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgable, and have a decent standard of living.
Each country is given a Human Development Index score from 0 to 1, where the higher the number,
the higher achievement of human development in the given year. In this section, we will compare
the relationship between Happiness Scores and HDI in countries to see if the development of a

scores in other characteristics that tend to have positive correlations to happiness. For example, Syria yield a low Happiness
score (3.069) for a relatively high HDI score (0.536). This can be attributed to their government system, for which they yield a
score of 0.06912, one of the lowest freedom scores, and a score of 0.17233 in Trust in Government. Another outlier we can examine
is Costa Rica, which has a relatively high Happiness score (7.087) for a relatively low HDI score (0.776). As compared to a country
such as Israel, with about the same Happiness score (7.267) and a higher HDI score (0.899). This can also be explained by the fact
that Costa Rica yields a Freedom Score of 0.55225 and a score of 0.10547 in Trust in Government. On the other hand, Israel has a
score of 0.36432 in Freedom and 0.08728 in Trust in Government. With a notably higher score in government related characteristics,
which are seen to have a positive correlation with Happiness, it is reasonable that Costa Rica is an outlier. But even with these
outliers, it is clear that the common trend for most countries is that higher Human Development leads to higher Happiness"

GDP Per Capita and Happiness Scores. Since all three of these results yield positive correlations with Happiness, this suggests that
the factor of Human Development alone, with no regards to Health/Life Expectancy and Economic Propserity, also yields a positive
correlation to Happiness. Thus, we can conclute that the development in a country contributes greatly to the
happiness of individuals within that Country. For this reason, it is clear why many of the countries who ranked high on

people are happier than people in NA, since the ranking they got is higher and the number of countries in their
region also outweigh NA, but not all the countries are as happy as, for example, Denmark. Regions that are more
